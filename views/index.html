                My name is Devon VanNote and I am currently in the running for the Web Backend Developer
                Position. I
                spun up
                this test Stripe payment app over the weekend just to refresh my knowledge on
                baseline Node JS as I have
                mainly worked with C# as my backend while making edits to Angular front-end applications. Following the
                Stripe documentation, some Googling, and a
                partial
                tutorial, I
                was able
                to bring in their custom card element (which is fantastic and such a time-saver holy moly) and
                successfully post test card data to their CHARGE endpoint.
            </p>

                In my freetime I have began to learn React which can be seen in my <a class="text-orange-400"
                    href="https://github.com/devonVanNote/ReactInstaClone" target="_blank">repository</a> as
                well. It's
                been a while
                since I
                committed to that ReactJS repo as I am currently helping two friends get a 2D game made in Unity
                3D to
                a very small
                alpha by March 1st. I am not too deep into React yet and would need to brush up for sure, but
                have
                enjoyed my time thus far.
